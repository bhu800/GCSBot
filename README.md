# GCSBot

GCS is Guidance and Counseling Service of IIT Mandi, which manages the whole admission process from councelling and registration to induction programme for newly joined students.  
A freshman joining the institute has a lot of information to search, assimilate and keep track of. What is the procedure for registration? When will I get my ID card? Where can I get food late at night around the campus? Which documents are required to submit at registration desk? How can I book institute guest house for my parents? These are just a few of the very common queries one might have apart from a ton of other academics and clubs related queries.
Although GCS tries it's best to help students with their queries by it's freshman-forum fb pages, faq pages and assigning mentors for each freshman, but still there is a scope for solving most of these queries much more quickly and efficiently, as they are generally standard and common among freshers.  

**GCSBot is a retrevial-based chatbot, which tries to solve the same problem.**
